# COVID-19 Treatment-Plan-Generation using Artificial Intelligence Algorithms
The main idea of this project is to develop a treatment plan generation for the people who are infected with COVID-19. There are 3.1M people who are tested positive for the virus and almost 1M people that is almost 33% of them are recovered. And the deaths are about 225,843 which is very bad . The main approach of this proposal is to increase the recovery percentage and decrease the number of deaths.  Since there is a transition of infected personâ€™s health state day by day ,  we collect the data - symptoms of infected persons and medications used day by day . The idea is to create a huge graph consisting of many nodes and edges. Nodes in this graph refers to the symptoms of the infected person at that state and edges refers to the medication used , time taken from reaching node A to node B and also the cost required for the treatment . When an infected person reaches the primary health centre his/her symptoms will be noted down and search for a node in this graph that matches with the symptoms. And after finding out the node we will generate a path to cure state which could be time effective or cost effective paths
